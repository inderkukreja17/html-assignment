        <p>Dhoni was contracted by the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for US$1.5 million. This made him the most expensive player in the IPL for the first season auctions.[139] Under his captaincy, CSK won the 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and the 2023 Indian Premier League titles and the 2010 and 2014 Champions League T20 titles and ended up as a runner-up in 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2019 IPL league seasons.[140][141]

            MS Dhoni became the first player to play 200 T20 matches for Super Kings. Dhoni is at the top of the list of most matches played in the Indian Premier League.[142] Dhoni is also one of the three captains to have won the Indian Premier League twice, with CSK.[143] Dhoni is the only captain in the IPL to win more than 100 matches. He is also the most successful wicket-keeper with 180 dismissals as of IPL 2023.</p>
        <p>In 2015, the Chennai Super Kings got banned from the IPL for 2 years by R.M. Lodha from the committee of Supreme Court of India.[144] They were banned due to the illegal betting of one of their officials, Gurunath Meiyappan.[145] He was arrested with charges of spot-fixing[146] According to Dhoni, it was darkest period of his career. He said "The biggest crime that I can commit is not a murder, it is actually match-fixing".[147][148]

            In 2016, Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS), a debuting IPL franchise team made him captain but after the poor performance of the team in that season they removed Dhoni from the captain's position and chose Steve Smith, then Australian national team captain, for the post. Dhoni played as wicketkeeper batsman in the 2017 season for RPS.[149]</p>
            <p>In the 2018 IPL season, CSK returned to IPL, and he was again appointed to lead the franchise by the franchise. Dhoni scored 455 runs in that season and led his side to their third IPL title.[150]

In the 2020 & 2021 seasons of the IPL, Dhoni failed to perform where he scored 200 runs in 14 innings in 2020 and 116 runs in 16 innings with an average of 15.29 in the 2021 IPL season.[20]

He led the franchise to the 4th title in 2021 Indian Premier League season. Dhoni got retained by CSK for â‚¹12 Cr, before IPL 2022 player's auction.[151] He stepped down from captaincy on 24 March 2022, where Ravindra Jadeja became the new captain.[152][153] However, on 30 April 2022, Jadeja handed over the captaincy back to Dhoni.[154]</p>
