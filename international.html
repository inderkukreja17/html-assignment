        <p>Start of ODI career

            The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.[58] The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.[58] With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[59] Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[60] In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series</p>
